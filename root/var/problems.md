Markup:
1. save to library button on product covers in not done
2. class "comics" doesn't exist though is used in _index.php
3. top (search) panel leaves screen borders when zoomed in and it won't horizontally scroll, so the elements are unaccessable.
4. users can open or download images.
5. filter buttons don't resize
6. when zooming out, content should stay together in the center of a page. It doesn't.
7. loop in _categories.php doesn't work. I don't know why
8. product page has bugs and is not finished.

Overall:
2. no url forwarding
